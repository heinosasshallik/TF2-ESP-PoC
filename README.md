# TF2-ESP-PoC
A proof of concept wallhack for Team Fortress 2  

Video (Screen recording sofware was not able to record the flickering boxes, so had to use my phone):

As a proof of concept it works, but it has some flaws:  
	The flickering is because frame buffering has not been implemented.  
	Vertical height not always displayed correctly.  
	If you want to use it, then you will have to update the offsets, they are outdated by now.
