# TF2-ESP-PoC
A proof of concept wallhack for Team Fortress 2  

Video (Screen recording sofware was not able to record the flickering boxes, so had to use my phone):

As a proof of concept it works, but it has some flaws:  
	The flickering is because frame buffering has not been implemented.  
	Vertical height not always displayed correctly.
	If you clone it, then the offsets are probably outdated by now.
