# TF2-ESP-PoC
A proof of concept wallhack for Team Fortress 2  

Video (Screen recording sofware was not able to record the flickering boxes, so had to use my phone):

As a proof of concept it works, but it has some flaws:  
	The flickering is because frame buffering has not been implemented.  
	It seems the calculations for vertical height may not be entirely correct.  
	If you clone it, then the offsets are probably outdated by now.
